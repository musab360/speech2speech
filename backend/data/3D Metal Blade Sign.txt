3D Metal Blade Sign

Description:
 A 3D metal blade sign is a projecting sign that is mounted perpendicular to a wall, making it highly visible from both directions along a street. Built from a durable stainless steel or aluminum frame, these signs are often double-sided and can be customized with finishes such as matte, glossy, or brushed metal. For illuminated versions, acrylic inserts can be incorporated, allowing the sign to stand out both day and night.
Construction:
 The structure of the sign is made with a stainless steel or aluminum frame that may be powder-coated or brushed, depending on the desired finish. The face of the sign is made of metal.
UV Printing Limitation:
 When UV printing is applied, the maximum size for any one side is 35 inches. Larger graphics or logos must be divided into multiple sections, but the divisions are subtle and not noticeable from a viewing distance.
Minimum Letter Height:
 The minimum recommended letter height for this type of sign is 4 inches, with a stroke width of at least 25 millimeters to ensure readability and clarity.
Wall Accessibility:
 Installing a 3D metal blade sign requires access to the side wall for proper mounting. It can be fixed using a wall bracket with chain or rod suspension for a classic hanging style, or with a rigid bracket projection for a more permanent setup.
Usage:
 These signs are commonly used in outdoor environments such as retail stores, cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. Their perpendicular positioning is designed to capture the attention of pedestrians walking along storefronts, making them highly effective in areas with foot traffic.
Mounting Options:
 Mounting is carried out with heavy-duty wall brackets secured with bolts or screws. Alternatively, a traditional look can be achieved with chain or rod suspension.
Accessories Included:
 Each sign comes with a wall bracket, screws, and an installation guide. If the sign is illuminated, it will also include an LED kit and power supply.
Packaging:
 For shipping and handling, the sign is carefully protected using thermopore layers, EPS foam, and corner guards to prevent damage to the metal frame during transit.
