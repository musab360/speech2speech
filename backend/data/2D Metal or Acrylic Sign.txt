2D Metal/Acrylic Sign

Description:
 A 2D Metal/Acrylic Sign is a flat, cut-out signage style made from acrylic or metal sheets, often designed with layered elements such as acrylic letters mounted on a metal base. This style creates a sleek and professional appearance that works well in both modern and classic environments. The signs are typically non-illuminated but can be enhanced with optional LED edge-lighting for added visual effect.
Construction:
 The sign is constructed with a stainless steel base plate, which can be finished in brushed or powder-coated textures to suit different design preferences. Letters and logos are created using either acrylic or metal cut-outs that are mounted securely onto the base. While the sign is usually non-illuminated, optional LED edge-lighting can be integrated to provide subtle accents, adding depth and emphasis to the design.
UV Printing Limitation:
 If the sign design includes UV-printed artwork or logos, the maximum print size allowed is 46 inches per side. Larger artwork will be split into sections, though the divisions are minimal and not visible from normal viewing distances.
Minimum Letter Height:
 The minimum recommended letter height for this type of sign is 3 inches, with a stroke width of either 2 millimeters, 5 millimeters, 10 millimeters or 12 millimeters to ensure clarity and proper readability.
Wall Accessibility:
 These signs can be mounted directly onto walls using screws or 3M adhesive, which is especially useful for lightweight indoor installations. Since the signs are typically non-illuminated, no internal wiring is required unless optional LED edge-lighting is included.
Usage:
 2D Metal/Acrylic Signs are commonly used in indoor environments such as offices, wellness centers, reception areas, and retail spaces. They are lightweight, versatile, and deliver an elegant, professional look suitable for branding and décor.
Mounting Options:
 There are three main installation methods: flush mounting with visible screws, which is standard and reliable, or hidden stud mounting, which creates a more premium, seamless appearance, or with bushes and 3M adhesive. For a sign to be mounted using bushes, it’s stroke width must be 12 millimeters minimum.
Accessories Included:
 Each sign is delivered with screws, studs, and an installation template.
Packaging:
 The signs are carefully packed using flat EPS foam sheets with bubble wrap to protect the acrylic surfaces and prevent scratches during transit.
Common Uses:
 These signs are ideal for indoor branding where a polished, professional appearance is desired. They are particularly effective in reception areas, wellness centers, and retail décor, where elegance and simplicity are key.
