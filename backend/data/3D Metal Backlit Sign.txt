3D Metal Backlit Sign

Description:
A 3D Metal Back Lit Sign, also known as a 3D Halo Lit Sign, is crafted from premium stainless steel letters or logos with elegant halo illumination. The light shines from behind the solid metal face, creating a glowing outline that casts a subtle halo effect on the background surface. This lighting method provides ambient visibility both during the day and at night without the need for external lighting. Because of its refined appearance, this sign style is commonly chosen for storefronts, retail outlets, offices, and commercial spaces where both readability and a high-end image are important.
Construction:
The sign is built with a stainless steel face and stainless steel sides, also known as returns, while the back is made with an acrylic diffuser that evenly spreads LED light to create a seamless halo effect. It is available in four distinct finishes: matte, which is non-reflective and customizable in any Pantone shade and is the only option allowed for UV-printed areas; glossy, which has a reflective shine and is available in any Pantone color; mirror, which reflects like glass and is limited to gold, silver, black, and rose gold; and brushed, which gives a textured look and is available in gold, silver, black, and bronze (also referred to as nickel or zinc).
UV Printing Limitation:
The maximum UV print size for this sign is 46 inches per side. When a design exceeds this dimension, it is divided into multiple sections, but the seams are virtually invisible from normal viewing distances. All UV-printed areas are finished in matte, and exact color reproduction can be achieved using CMY color codes.
Minimum Letter Height:
The recommended minimum letter height for this sign is 2.5 inches, with a minimum stroke width of 15 millimeters. The side depth of the returns is 1.5 inches, ensuring sufficient depth for the halo lighting to appear distinct.
Wall Accessibility:
Proper installation requires wall access for wiring. To conceal wires, a raceway or backboard can be provided and customized with Pantone color matching to blend with the mounting surface. For outdoor installations, a 3D backboard or raceway is recommended for added durability, while indoor settings only require a 2D version.
Usage:
These signs are designed for both indoor and outdoor applications and are especially effective in premium environments such as storefronts, luxury retail, corporate offices, spas, and hotels.
Mounting Options:
The sign can be installed using two mounting methods. Flush mounting attaches the letters directly to the wall with no gap, while stud mounting raises the sign slightly off the wall, adding depth and enhancing the halo lighting effect.
Accessories Included:
Each order includes screws, an installation guide, a power supply, and LED components, ensuring all necessary parts are provided for setup.
Packaging:
To prevent damage during transit, the sign is packed with multiple protective layers including thermopore sheets, EPS foam, bubble wrap, and cushioning foam around sensitive edges and LED components.
Common Uses:
3D Metal Back Lit Signs are ideal for applications that demand sophistication, visibility, and clarity, including storefronts, high-end retail shops, wellness centers, restaurants, and corporate branding.
