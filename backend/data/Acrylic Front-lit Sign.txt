Acrylic Front-lit Sign:
Description
This type of sign features acrylic letters or logos with internal lighting, similar to light boxes. The light shines through the front face of acrylic, providing bright, even illumination and sharp definition, ensuring excellent visibility, especially in low-light conditions. These signs are commonly used in storefronts, retail spaces, and commercial signage where readability is crucial.
Construction:
The sign is built with a translucent acrylic face, stainless steel back, and stainless steel sides that we also call returns. The face diffuses the light. Internal LED lights are strategically fixed to ensure consistent lighting from within. The sign is available in both matte and glossy finishes but only matte finish is available for UV-printed areas.
UV Printing Limitation:
If the sign requires UV printing and if any one side exceeds 46 inches (4 ft) then make sure to tell the customer that the sign will be split into multiple parts depending upon the size of their sign. The division won’t be visible from a distance due to the large size and distant viewing. The maximum UV print size is 46 inches, and larger prints must be in parts. If the sign includes a UV-printed logo, the logo area will be matte. Exact colors can be matched using CMY color codes.
Minimum Letter Height:
The minimum letter height for the sign should be 4 inches, with a minimum stroke width of 25mm. The side depth of the returns is typically 2.5 inches but can be increased up to 3 inches for safety.
Wall Accessibility:
This sign requires wall accessibility due to the wiring. A raceway or backboard can be provided depending on the customer’s needs. If the wall is not accessible or the customer prefers fewer visible wires then make sure to offer a backboard or raceway. It can be color-matched to the wall using Pantone shades. For outdoor use, a 3D backboard/raceway is recommended for additional wire protection, while a 2D version is sufficient for indoor use.
Usage:
The sign is suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments.
Mounting Options:
This type of sign offers 3 mounting options: Flush mount using metal screws (standard), Stud mounting and Suspended mounting using rods, cables, chains or rods.

Packaging
The sign is securely packed using thermopore layers, EPS foam, bubble wrap, and cushioning foam to protect sensitive parts during transit.
Common Uses:
These signs are perfect for storefronts, retail environments, and commercial signage, where visibility and clarity are essential.
