3D Frontlit and Backlit Sign

Description:
 A 3D Front Lit & Back Lit Sign is a hybrid signage option that combines both face-lit and back-lit illumination. The acrylic face allows light to shine forward, providing bright visibility from the front, while the open back creates a halo glow that radiates around the letters. This dual-lighting effect produces maximum brightness, depth, and impact, making the sign highly noticeable in both daytime and nighttime environments. It is especially popular for clients who want their branding to stand out with a premium, modern appearance.
Construction:
 The sign’s face is made of translucent acrylic to allow even front illumination. The body is built with stainless steel returns, typically minimum 3 inches in depth, providing durability and a bold structure. The back is left open to accommodate the halo effect, with LEDs positioned both at the front and rear for dual illumination. This careful arrangement ensures consistent brightness and a striking visual balance.
UV Printing Limitation:
 If UV printing is required on the acrylic face, the maximum printable size is limited to 46 inches on any side. Larger designs will be divided into sections, though these splits are not visible from a standard viewing distance once the sign is illuminated.
Minimum Letter Height:
 For optimal effect, the recommended minimum letter height is 3.5 inches with a minimum stroke width of 25 millimeters. These dimensions ensure the lighting effect is both functional and visually appealing. 
Wall Accessibility:
 Installation requires access to the wall for wiring. For outdoor applications, a raceway or backboard is strongly recommended to protect wires and ensure long-term durability, while indoor installations may use a simpler flush mount.
Usage:
 These signs are often installed in shopping malls, restaurants, and flagship retail stores. They are the preferred choice for businesses seeking maximum visibility and a premium illuminated effect that captures attention at all hours.
Mounting Options:
 Mounting can be done using flush screws that secure the sign directly to the wall or with a raceway/backboard, which conceals wiring and provides additional structural support.
Accessories Included:
 Each order includes a power supply, LED components, screws, a backboard option if needed, and an installation guide.
Packaging:
 To protect the dual-lighting components, the sign is carefully packed with thermopore wrapping, EPS foam, and custom-cut cushions that prevent damage during transit.
