Lightbox Sign

Description:
 A Lightbox Sign is a rectangular or square box structure designed with an internally illuminated face panel. The face is typically made from translucent acrylic, which can be customized with either vinyl graphics or UV-printed designs. Bright, even lighting is achieved through internal LEDs, making the sign highly visible both day and night. Because of its bold design and wide surface area, this type of sign is especially effective for businesses that require strong visibility from a distance.
Construction:
 The frame of the sign is built from either aluminum or stainless steel, forming a durable box-like structure. The face is crafted from translucent acrylic, which may be printed directly using UV technology or covered with vinyl-applied graphics. Internal LED panels are installed to provide uniform illumination across the entire surface, ensuring that the sign glows consistently without dark spots. Depending on its size, the depth of the box ranges from 3 to 5 inches for Rod Mounted Lightbox Sign & 4 to 5 inches for Wall Mounted Lightbox Sign, balancing strength with sleek design.
UV Printing Limitation:
 When UV printing is applied, the maximum print size is 46 inches on any one side. If the design exceeds this limit, it must be divided into sections. However, once illuminated, the joints between sections are barely noticeable. For a projected lightbox sign, the maximum print size is 35 inches on any one side.
Minimum Letter Height:
 There is no strict minimum letter height for this type of sign since graphics and logos can be printed across the entire face. However, for practical readability, it is recommended that letters be at least 2 inches in height.
Wall Accessibility:
 Installation requires access for power wiring. For cleaner installations, especially in outdoor settings, a raceway can be used to conceal wiring and enhance durability.
Usage:
 Lightbox Signs are commonly used in large-scale applications such as retail chains, gas stations, shopping malls, and corporate branding. Their design makes them particularly effective for long-distance visibility, making them ideal for roadside or high-traffic locations.
Mounting Options:
 These signs can be mounted directly onto walls as the standard installation method. Alternatively, they can be mounted on poles for greater elevation and visibility in outdoor spaces.
Accessories Included:
 Each sign includes a power supply, an LED lighting kit, screws, and an installation guide to ensure straightforward setup.
Packaging:
 To safeguard both the frame and the face during transportation, Lightbox Signs are packaged with thermopore sheets, corner protectors, and cushioning material around the acrylic face and box edges.
