3D Metal Non Lit Sign

Description:
 A 3D Metal Non Lit Sign, also known as 3D Metal Channel Letters or a Non-Illuminated Metal Sign, is made from premium stainless steel letters or logos without any internal or back lighting. These signs rely on their depth, finish, and precise placement to create a bold and professional appearance. While they maintain strong visibility during the day, they require external lighting sources to remain visible at night. Because of their clean, classic style, they are frequently used in storefronts, corporate offices, and commercial spaces where a high-end look is desired.
Construction:
 The sign is constructed entirely from stainless steel, with side returns that are approximately 1.5 inches deep. It is available in four finish options to suit different design preferences. The matte finish is non-reflective and can be produced in any Pantone color, and it is the required finish for UV-printed areas. The glossy finish has a reflective surface and is also available in any Pantone color. The mirror finish offers a highly reflective look and is limited to gold, silver, black, and rose gold. Lastly, the brushed finish provides a textured effect and is available in gold, silver, black, and bronze (also referred to as nickel or zinc).
UV Printing Limitation:
 When UV printing is applied, the maximum size for any one side is 46 inches. Designs that exceed this limit will be split into multiple sections, though the divisions are not visible from standard viewing distances. All UV-printed logos and artwork will have a matte finish, and exact colors can be matched using CMY color codes.
Minimum Letter Height:
 The recommended minimum letter height for this sign is 1 inch with a stroke width of 10 to 12 millimeters. The side depth, or returns, is approximately 1.5 inches, ensuring durability and strong definition.
Wall Accessibility:
 Installation requires drilling holes into the wall for each individual letter or logo component. If drilling multiple holes is not possible, a raceway or backboard can be provided to support the entire sign. These backboards or raceways can be Pantone color-matched to blend seamlessly with the wall.
Usage:
 This type of sign is suitable for both indoor and outdoor installations. It is ideal for storefronts, corporate offices, retail branding, and commercial buildings that want a durable, elegant, and professional appearance without illumination.
Mounting Options:
 There are two mounting options for this sign. Flush mounting secures the letters directly against the wall with screws, leaving no gap. Stud mounting raises the letters slightly away from the wall, creating a floating effect and adding depth.
Accessories Included:
 Each order includes screws and an installation guide to assist with proper setup.
Packaging:
 To prevent damage during transportation, the sign is securely packaged with thermopore sheets, EPS foam, bubble wrap, and cushioning foam, protecting both the stainless steel surfaces and edges.
Common Uses:
 3D Metal Non Lit Signs are most commonly used for storefront branding, office buildings, retail environments, and commercial signage where a sophisticated, long-lasting, and professional look is required without illumination.
